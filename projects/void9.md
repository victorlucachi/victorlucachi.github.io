## Description
The VOID9 Macropad is a handwired 3x3 pad that uses a Pro Micro as a controller.

Two versions for the top case are included, one of them is flat, the other has a 4mm fillet.
There are two versions for the bottom case as well, a flat one, and a 5 degree angled version.

## BOM
- 4 x M3x10 allen head screws for the bottom/top corners (13mm overall length, 5.5mm diameter head)
- hot glue for securing the Pro Micro to the bottom case

## STL Download and QMK Fork
The STL files can be downloaded from Github, along with a QMK fork that contains a basic keymap and experimental VIA Configurator support. More info [here](https://github.com/victorlucachi/void9)
