The VOID9 is, as the name implies, a 9 key programmable macropad; it has a tiny footprint but it's powered by the incredibly powerful and versatile [QMK Firmware](https://qmk.fm/)

It features a 3x3 grid of keys that are mounted on a 3d printed, hand sanded to a smooth finish plate/case, soldered on a high quality custom PCB and powered by a Pro Micro that is running the QMK Firmware.

The macropad is fully programmable thanks to  [VIA Configurator](https://caniusevia.com/), and its intuitive easy to use GUI; we will provide links to the QMK Documentation as well as assistance, if needed, for buyers that have issues with configuring the macropad according to their own needs.
